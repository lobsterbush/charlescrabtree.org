# Recommendations for Honorary Research Fellow Positions

**Date:** 2026-01-25

## CV Placement & Structure

**Recommended approach: Create a dedicated subsection with clear visual hierarchy**

Structure your Appointments section as:

```
APPOINTMENTS

Primary Appointments
• Senior Lecturer (Associate Professor), School of Social Sciences, Monash University (2025–)
• K-CLUB Professor, University College, Korea University (2024–)

Honorary Research Fellow Positions
• Honorary Research Fellow, [Institution Name], Japan (YYYY–)
• Honorary Research Fellow, [Institution Name], Korea (YYYY–)
• Honorary Research Fellow, [Institution Name], Japan (YYYY–)
```

**Rationale:**
- **Maintains professional hierarchy** while giving honorary positions meaningful visibility
- **Signals depth of regional engagement** without overstating their nature
- **Standard academic convention** – most CVs distinguish primary from affiliated/honorary roles
- **Easy to scan** – readers immediately understand your employment vs. network positions

**Alternative formatting option:** Use subtle visual distinction (e.g., regular vs. italic font for honorary positions) if you prefer a flatter structure, but I recommend against this as it can create confusion about employment status.

## Website Placement

**Recommended approach: Multi-layered integration across three touchpoints**

### 1. Hero Section (Primary placement)
Add a third position card for honorary affiliations:

```
[Monash Card] [Korea University Card] [Regional Networks Card]
```

The third card could read:
- **"Regional Research Networks"** or **"Asia-Pacific Affiliations"**
- Role: "Honorary Research Fellow"
- Dept: "Multiple institutions across Japan and Korea"

This creates visual symmetry (three cards) while signaling deep regional integration without claiming equal weight to primary appointments.

**Alternative:** Add a subtle line of text below the existing two cards:
> "Honorary Research Fellow at [X] universities across Japan and Korea"

### 2. Index/About Page (Narrative integration)
In the bio section where you discuss Asia-Pacific research, add a sentence like:

> "I hold honorary research fellow positions at universities in Japan and Korea, reflecting long-standing collaborations and sustained engagement with regional scholarly communities."

Place this near the paragraph about your work in Asia-Pacific and Eastern Europe.

### 3. Collaboration Page (Detailed context)
Add a new section called **"Institutional Affiliations"** or **"Regional Research Networks"** after the coauthors section:

```markdown
## Institutional Affiliations

I hold honorary research fellow positions at the following institutions, 
reflecting sustained collaborative relationships across the Asia-Pacific:

• [Institution Name], Japan (YYYY–present)
• [Institution Name], Korea (YYYY–present)
• [Institution Name], Japan (YYYY–present)

These affiliations support ongoing research collaborations, visiting scholar 
arrangements, and engagement with regional scholarly communities.
```

**Rationale for this three-part approach:**
- **Hero section**: Immediate visibility for first-time visitors, reinforces regional identity
- **About page**: Narrative context that feels organic rather than list-like
- **Collaboration page**: Natural home for institutional relationships; visitors interested in collaboration will find detailed information here
- **Avoids redundancy**: Each placement serves a different rhetorical purpose
- **Scalable**: Easy to add more positions as your network grows

## Additional Considerations

**For both CV and website:**
- List institutions in reverse chronological order by start date
- Include dates to show ongoing vs. concluded affiliations
- Consider briefly noting what these positions entail (e.g., "visiting scholar arrangements," "collaborative research," "graduate student co-supervision") either in a footnote (CV) or in the collaboration page description (website)

**Website-specific:**
- If you have 4+ honorary positions, the hero section card becomes more valuable to avoid listing them all in the bio
- The collaboration page placement works well because it connects to the coauthors map – showing both individual and institutional networks
- Consider linking from the hero card to the collaboration page for those wanting details
