<p>The most impactful work occurs when <a href="https://sites.lsa.umich.edu/scottepage/wp-content/uploads/sites/344/2015/11/pnas.pdf" target="_blank">diverse groups</a> tackle <a href="https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/pdf/10.1287/mnsc.14.4.B141" target="_blank">complex problems</a>. I help create these groups in my work and in various community-building endeavors.</p>

</section>

<section class="section">
<h2>Community building</h2>

<p>I enjoy engaging with scholarly communities and have participated in more than 140 conferences and workshops since beginning graduate school. I also enjoy building and strengthening scholarly communities related to my research interests. I've organized (or co-organized) 4 conferences, 7 mini-conferences, and nearly 200 seminars and workshops. </p>

            <div class="alert alert-info">
    <p>🎓 I've been fortunate to visit <a href="universities.html">over 100 universities worldwide</a> for conferences, talks, and workshops. Each visit has been a reminder of why these spaces matter so much.</p>
</div>

<h3>Virtual workshops</h3>

<p>I’ve taken a particular interest in virtual workshops, since they democratize the spread of research and the dissemination of high-quality feedback. </p>

<h3>APOSS</h3>

<p>I've founded or co-founded three long-standing virtual workshops. Most recently, I was the founder and co-organizer of the <a href="http://aposs.cc/" target="_blank">Asian Politics Online Political Seminar Series (APOSS)</a>. Motivated by the wave of conference and seminar cancellations in the spring of 2020, the series aimed to provide political scientists working in, on, or adjacent to Asia with a forum where they could receive feedback about their work in progress. The series ran for 104 workshops and had an active community of nearly 500 scholars subscribed to its mailing list.</p>

<div class="image-card">
    <img src="images/aposs-presentation.png" alt="APOSS presentation screenshot" loading="lazy">
    <span class="img-caption">One of so many great APOSS presentations</span>
</div>

<p>A survey I conducted of APOSS attendees shows that folks found the workshop more useful for their research than attending annual professional conferences <em>and</em> better than other online seminar series. Attendees praised the workshop extensively for its approach to diversity and building community. </p>

<h3>Select APOSS evaluation written comments</h3>

<div class="feedback-masonry">
<blockquote class="medium">This workshop has been a gem for many scholars who do not have many opportunities to network with other scholars and to present their work.</blockquote>

<blockquote class="medium">This workshop did a better job in maintaining equity. I find other workshops elitist, clearly favoring participants from elitist universities.</blockquote>

<blockquote class="short">[It's] accessible to all scholars including early career scholars, graduate students and international scholars.</blockquote>

<blockquote class="medium">Thank you immensely for coordinating this - it was an absolute lifesaver for me, especially during the challenging times of COVID.</blockquote>

<blockquote class="long">By giving PhD students/candidates the chance to present their research virtually, APOSS is really a valuable platform to increase early career researchers the chance to introduce their works. Furthermore, since it is online, scholars from third-world countries like myself can present my research without worrying about visa issues.</blockquote>
</div>

<h3>JPOSS</h3>

<p>I was also co-founder and co-organizer of the <a href="http://jposs.org/" target="_blank">Japanese Politics Online Seminar Series (JPOSS)</a>, a virtual forum for presenting and discussing research-in-progress on questions related to Japanese politics, broadly defined. The series, which is still ongoing, ran for 40 sessions before I left my role.</p>

    <img src="images/jposs-presentation.png" alt="JPOSS presentation screenshot" loading="lazy">
    <span class="img-caption">One of many great JPOSS presentations</span>
</div>

<h3>VWAR</h3>

<p>In addition, I co-founded and co-organized the <a href="http://authoritarianregimes.org/" target="_blank">Virtual Workshop on Authoritarian Regimes (VWAR)</a> for several years. This virtual workshop, one of the first in political science, provided scholars of authoritarian regimes with an opportunity to receive feedback from multiple discussants on their research in progress. Over my four years of involvement, we held 43 sessions.</p>

    <img src="images/vwar-presentation.png" alt="VWAR presentation screenshot" loading="lazy">
    <span class="img-caption">And one of many great VWAR presentations</span>
</div>

<h3>Workshop presenter feedback</h3>

<p>A survey I continuously conducted of VWAR and APOSS presenters shows that most participants <a href="https://www.notion.so/7a58ff50f7dd425c91148fa424494e46?pvs=21" target="_blank">(1) thought that their participation was more useful for their research than presenting at a large conference and (2) rated VWAR/APOSS better than other virtual workshops at which they had presented</a>.</p>

<h3>Research on collaboration and scientific community</h3>

<p>Based on my experience running several virtual workshops, I prepared a <a href="https://www.notion.so/Building-Community-and-Improving-Diversity-Equity-and-Inclusion-in-Political-Science-through-Virtu-957e1fb38cdb43de8ade2f5ad4d4d165?pvs=21" target="_blank">spotlight for <em>PS: Political Science & Politics</em> that examines how these spaces can enhance diversity, equity, and inclusion in the discipline</a>. </p>
