> Charles is such a wonderful professor. If this is him in his first term of teaching I can only imagine how great he's going to be a few terms from now. He is incredibly willing to meet outside of class for help because he has so much time available for office hours. He really cares about us as students and wants us to learn
> 

> Charles was fantastic. He was also enthusiastic and available and genuinely cared about our opinions!
> 

> Professor Crabtree is really good at meeting students where they are, whether that's how much they know about R or how much they're familiar with running surveys. Great teaching for his first term, and great teaching in general.
