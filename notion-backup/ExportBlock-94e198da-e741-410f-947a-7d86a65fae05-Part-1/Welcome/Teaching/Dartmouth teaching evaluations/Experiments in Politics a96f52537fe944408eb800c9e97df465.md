> Crabtree is one of the most caring professors I have had the privilege of working with during my four years at Dartmouth. If you are looking for someone who has your best interest, as a student, but more importantly, as a person, in mind when making decisions then you should absolutely take a class with him. He also was great at fielding the survey based on what he thought was reasonable for us. For instance, out project was a rather complex multi-level conjoint and so he never expected us to take on more the coding as it likely exceeded our skill level. Nonetheless, I learned a lot about the experimental design process throughout this course.
