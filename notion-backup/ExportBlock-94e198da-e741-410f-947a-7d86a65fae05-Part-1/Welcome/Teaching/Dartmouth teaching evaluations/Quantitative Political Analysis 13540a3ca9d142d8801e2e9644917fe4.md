> Professor Crabtree was the best professor I have had at Dartmouth. He was down to earth, helpful, and genuinely cared about his students. He was always willing to meet with us and genuinely wanted to get to know us. He met with my research group multiple times throughout the term (even when he was very busy he always made time for us). Additionally, he responded to emails very quickly which helped answer any questions we had if we were unavailable to meet. Also, his lectures were engaging and he made me want to learn more. He was inspiring and furthered my knowledge in statistics.
> 

> The professor should continue to be understanding and very helpful to the students. Out of any professor I had at Dartmouth, Professor Crabtree was by far the most understanding and accessible to his students.
