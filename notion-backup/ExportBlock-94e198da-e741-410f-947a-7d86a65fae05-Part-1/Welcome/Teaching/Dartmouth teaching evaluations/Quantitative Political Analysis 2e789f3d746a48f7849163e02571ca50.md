> prof crabtree is one of the best professors i have had in my time at dartmouth. he is incredibly supportive, explains statistical concepts very well, and is also excellent at demonstrating why statistical analysis matters to a group of people who was mostly only in the class to fulfill a prereq or distributive. i never expected to have a good time in this class, but it ended up being actually pretty enjoyable and i learned a lot.
> 

> Charles was the best professor I have had at Dartmouth. He made everything easy to understand, and as an in-season athlete he was super flexible with deadlines. He also made everything in the class engaging by putting it in real world context. Essentially he made Data Science enjoyable, which is no easy task.
