# Opportunities for High School Research Assistants

**Early exposure matters.** I deeply believe that students benefit from seeing possible career paths early, whether by shadowing or trying out (“prototyping”) new roles. Even brief, structured experiences can broaden horizons and help young people imagine futures they might not otherwise see.

**Access matters.** I also believe in democratizing academic opportunities - making them available as widely as possible, not just to those who already have connections to universities. High school research assistants in my lab are part of this commitment.

## **What You’ll Do**

Research assistants will take on well-defined, skill-building tasks such as:

- Collecting and organizing data from public sources.
- Cleaning and formatting datasets (e.g., in Excel or Google Sheets).
- Coding or annotating text materials using clear instructions.
- Checking references, links, and factual details.
- Helping maintain bibliographies and research files.
- **Shadowing lab meetings** - quietly observing and learning how academic teams collaborate, design studies, and discuss findings.

## **What You Won’t Do**

To keep tasks appropriate for your level of training:

- You will not be asked to write literature reviews or theory.
- You will not work with confidential or sensitive data.
- You will not be expected to have prior knowledge of advanced methods.

## **What You’ll Gain**

- **Exposure**: first-hand insight into what social science research looks like, including observing real lab meetings.
- **Skill development**: practical training in data organization, annotation, and basic research support.
- **Mentorship**: opportunities to ask questions about political science, research, and college preparation.
- **Experience**: a meaningful line on your résumé or college applications, demonstrating initiative and engagement.

## **Time Commitment**

- Flexible — typically 3–5 hours per week for a set period (such as a school term).
- Work is designed to be remote and asynchronous.

## **How to Apply**

If you are a high school student interested in joining the lab, [please send me an email](mailto:crabtree@dartmouth.edu) with the following:

- A short statement (3–4 sentences) about why you’re interested.
- A résumé (if you have one, not required).
- Your availability during the school year or summer.
