# Thesis and Independent Study Guidance

I have high expectations for students who want me to advise an honors thesis or independent study. This is because I expect our work and my mentoring relationship with them to continue after the honors or independent study research project. After completing their thesis or independent study, I encourage students to work with me to adapt their paper into a coauthored article and then submit it to a peer-reviewed journal. I also encourage students to present their work at an academic conference, supporting them and their participation as necessary.

To achieve these goals, students must work hard. They must read a lot, develop technical skills, and do more than the minimum necessary to meet requirements. More on that below. In exchange, I treat these students as graduate students, as scholars in training, and to invest in their development accordingly. This means that I actively provide research feedback, help students apply for fellowships and grants, write letters of recommendation, and help them as they pursue their post-grad goals.

# Preparation

To make the thesis and independent study experience as productive as possible, I advise students to take the following steps in the months before they begin work.

- Review the excellent [Research Methods Knowledge Base](https://conjointly.com/kb/), particularly the construct, external, and internal validity sections.
- Learn [R](https://cran.r-project.org/). You might have been trained in Python or Stata, but I’m most proficient with R and will want you to use that for your work.
- Experiment with using generative AI, like [chatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/), to help you code. This can be a huge force multiplier.
- Start putting together a bibliography of relevant works in [Mendeley](https://www.mendeley.com/) or [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/).

If, after reading this, you remain excited about the prospect of doing an honor thesis or independent project with me, [please let me know](../Teaching/Dartmouth%20teaching%20evaluations%20aef4c1ba07f148ef8ec9ddba7d98062a.md). I look forward to working with you.
