# Visited colleges and universities

When I was a young child, my mom and I would visit [Western Washington University](https://www.wwu.edu/) every Sunday. They held public showings of *Star Trek: The Next Generation* episodes and provided free food to attendees. It was often the best meal we’d have all week. Perhaps because of my special times at WWU, colleges and universities have long been special places to me. They are beacons of learning and hope in a world that too often seems disinterested in both, and they’re also crucial centers of community. I enjoy visiting as many of them as possible. Please invite me to yours! 🧳
