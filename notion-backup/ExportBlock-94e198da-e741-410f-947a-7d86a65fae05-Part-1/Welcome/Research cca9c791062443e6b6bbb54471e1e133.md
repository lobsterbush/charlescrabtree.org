# Research

My working papers examine various aspects of intergroup relations and conflict. They primarily focus on measuring discrimination in new contexts and for understudied identity groups, developing more effective methodological approaches for measuring discrimination, and exploring ways to reduce it. 

My works in progress draw on my experiences in extreme poverty and primarily focus on understanding the attitudes (political and otherwise) of individuals facing food and housing needs, as well as what the public thinks of them. This work is housed in a new lab, the [Fundamental Needs Lab](http://needslab.org), and represents, in many ways, both the joining of my personal experiences and research and also the culmination of my years working on human rights and discrimination.

I also have some projects that examine disability discrimination, building on my years living in a group home for people with developmental disabilities and my work with the disabled community in Colorado. In addition to these substantive areas, I am working on several methodological  projects that introduce new ways of measuring discrimination, human rights, inclusivity, and other important social science concepts.
