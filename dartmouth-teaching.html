            <section class="section">
                <p class="lead">From 2020 to 2025, I taught at Dartmouth College, where I developed and led courses in statistical reasoning, experimental methods, and the politics of democratization and discrimination. This page preserves the complete record of that formative period in my teaching career.</p>
            </section>

            <section class="section">
                <h2>Statistical reasoning and research design</h2>

                <p>I taught three classes at Dartmouth that promote statistical reasoning and a better understanding of research design.</p>

                <p>In <em>Quantitative Political Analysis</em>, I taught students the basics of computational social science, with their work culminating in a quantitative-focused research paper. In <em>Experiments in Politics</em>, I taught students how to design, implement, analyze, and write up the results from an experiment focused on discrimination. I worked with students to do this throughout the term, intending to publish the paper after the quarter ends. I've published two papers with students using this approach so far.</p>

                <p>In addition to these courses, I co-directed the Department of Government's Honors Program with Professor <a href="https://faculty-directory.dartmouth.edu/lucas-swaine" target="_blank">Lucas Swaine</a> for a year and a half. In this position, I helped students build on their earlier methods classes, such as <em>Quantitative Political Analysis</em> and <em>Experiments in Politics</em>, and guided them in producing their own independent research. The program required students to complete the <em>Honors Research in Government</em> course in the fall, to spend the winter and spring terms working on their research with their faculty advisers, and to defend their thesis in a public presentation at the end of the year.</p>

<h2>Baltic LEAP Foreign Study Program</h2>

                <p>In line with my research on discrimination and intergroup contact, I believe that intercultural experiences can reduce negative biases and broaden students' understanding of political systems. This belief motivated me to co-found and co-direct one of Dartmouth's most innovative study abroad programs.</p>

                <p>I co-founded and twice co-directed <a href="https://irving.dartmouth.edu/education/experiential-learning-0/baltic-leap-language-energy-and-politics-foreign-study-program" target="_blank">Dartmouth's Baltic LEAP (language, energy, and politics) foreign studies program</a> (FSP). This quarter-length program took students through the three Baltic countries, with students spending about four weeks in Vilnius, two weeks in Riga, and another four weeks in Tartu. In addition to these locations, I and other faculty took students on day or weekend trips to Jūrmala, Kaunas, Klaipėda, Daugavpils, Narva, Sillamäe, and Tallinn. They completed a full course load while participating in various <a href="https://t.ly/NSw8V" target="_blank">excursions</a> (e.g., over 20 field trips in the 24-25 academic year; <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/tPEs1mLENgsWNpyVA" target="_blank">📷 from our trips</a>). The <a href="https://guarini.dartmouth.edu/" target="_blank">Guarini Institute of International Education</a> lauded this FSP as "innovative" and "cutting edge."</p>

                <p>As part of this program, I taught <a href="https://t.ly/9nRDv" target="_blank"><em>Baltic Politics</em></a>, a course that explores the region through topics related to democracy and discrimination, focusing on the real-world conflicts between representation and inclusion. The course incorporated local voices and featured guest lectures from nearby academics, diplomatic staff (including ambassadors), journalists, and policy professionals. It's one of only two classes on the politics of the Baltics offered by universities in the United States.</p>

                </div>

                <p>While Dartmouth does not collect course evaluations for courses offered in FSPs or about FSPs, students provided extensive positive feedback about the overall program. They called it "truly life-changing!" "by far the most unique experience you will have," and "honestly … one of the best experiences of my life."</p>

                <p>In a survey conducted three months after the inaugural FSP, students indicated their participation in the program (1) influenced their understanding of their own cultural identity and biases, (2) made them take a more global view of things, and (3) helped them better connect with different types of people.</p>

                    <blockquote class="medium">I've nothing but the absolute best things to say about Charles Crabtree. One of my favorite professors I've had on this campus and made class so fun while also challenging.</blockquote>

                    <blockquote class="long">Professor Crabtree was the best professor I've had at Dartmouth. He was down to earth, helpful, and genuinely cared about his students. He was always willing to meet with us and genuinely wanted to get to know us. He met with my research group multiple times throughout the term (even when he was very busy he always made time for us). Additionally, he responded to emails very quickly which helped answer any questions we had if we were unavailable to meet. Also, his lectures were engaging and he made me want to learn more. He was inspiring and furthered my knowledge in statistics.</blockquote>

                    <blockquote class="long">This was a fantastic class! It's hard to shout out specific things that were most effective, because the entire class was very effective. Professor Crabtree was a great lecturer, and the class was really well structured with group problem sets, individual readings, and our research project, which was a great way to apply our learning to an interesting, real-world topic. Professor Crabtree also wrote really good exams (they made me think so deeply about the course material).</blockquote>

                    <blockquote class="medium">Prof. Crabtree is one of the most empathetic professors I've ever met, and this makes him a great teacher who prioritizes students' growth.</blockquote>

                    <blockquote class="medium">Professor Crabtree is very engaging and energetic. He is very supportive and makes himself frequently accessible to students. He is a kind person and wants to make a positive impact.</blockquote>

                    <blockquote class="long">prof crabtree is one of the best professors i have had in my time at dartmouth. he is incredibly supportive, explains statistical concepts very well, and is also excellent at demonstrating why statistical analysis matters to a group of people who was mostly only in the class to fulfill a prereq or distributive. i never expected to have a good time in this class, but it ended up being actually pretty enjoyable and i learned a lot.</blockquote>

                    <blockquote class="medium">The professor is one of the kindest most understanding people, and as such engagement in the class was incredibly high. We were able to think of great ideas and felt supported in the environment.</blockquote>

                    <blockquote class="short">Amazing teaching and good class structure.</blockquote>

                    <blockquote class="short">Professor Crabtree is by far the best professor I've had at Dartmouth.</blockquote>
